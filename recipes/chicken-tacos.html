      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>These tacos are easy, quick, and scrumptious! I used to make these a lot in college. They're pretty cheap as well, I suggest inviting people over to eat these with you since there will be alot to go around!</p>

    <ul>
      <div><h2>Ingredients</h2></div>
      <li>½ medium red onion, thinly sliced (lengthwise, from root to stem end)</li>
      <li>1 cup hot water (tap water is fine)</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons fresh lime juice </li>
      <li>2 tablespoons fresh orange juice</li>
      <li>2 cups shredded, cooked chicken, warmed</li>
      <li>2 chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, chopped, plus 2 tablespoons adobo sauce</li>
      <li>6 ounces medium Cheddar, Monterey Jack or queso Chihuahua, grated </li>
      <li>8(6-inch) corn tortillas</li>
      <li>Sliced avocado, salsa and lime wedges, for serving</li>
    </ul>
    
    <ol>
      <div><h2>Steps</h2></div>
      <li>Set an oven rack in the middle position; heat the oven to 375 degrees.</li>
      <li>In a medium bowl, stir the onion, hot water and 1 teaspoon salt until the salt has dissolved. Let sit for 5 minutes. This will soften the onion and lessen any bitter or harsh flavors. Rinse the onion under cold water and drain. In the same bowl, toss the onion with the oregano, lime juice, orange juice and ½ teaspoon salt; reserve.</li>
      <li>In a separate bowl, quickly toss together the chicken, peppers and adobo sauce, making sure the chicken is completely coated. Season with salt. Cover and keep warm.</li>
      <li>Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone mat (do not use foil or the cheese might stick). Arrange cheese in 8 equal mounds on the prepared baking sheet. Spread each mound evenly to about 3 inches wide, and space at least 1 inch apart. Bake until the cheese is bubbly and deep golden brown in spots and around the edges, about 14 minutes. Remove from the oven and place 1 tortilla over each cheese crust and return to the oven to heat the tortillas, about 2 minutes.</li>
      <li>Use tongs to carefully remove each tortilla with its costra, flipping each one onto a plate so that the cheese is facing up. Top with chicken, onions, avocado, salsa and a squeeze of lime.</li>
    </ol>
